# Ayquza's Grief Utility Addon  

⚠️ **Important:** This addon was made to be used with the **MLPI Scanner** — join us on [discord.gg/mlp1](https://dsc.gg/mlpi).  
Big credits to **[@rbmkblaze](https://github.com/rbmkblaze)** for the login command!

## ✨ Features  

### 🔑 Login Command  
Log into cracked accounts with:  
- `.login (name)`  
- `.l (name)`  

(**Auto Reconnects you**)  

Additional login-related commands:  
- `.login clear` → clears all cracked accounts from the account manager  
- `.login random`  
- `.login remove`  
- `.login list`  

---

### ⌨️ Login Command Keybind Module  
- Set a keybind in the module.  
- When pressed, the addon will automatically run `.login (clipboard content)`.  

**Example:** Copy a name → press the keybind → instantly log in as that account.  

*Autoreconnect option included (enabled by default).*  

---

### 👤 Clipboard Reconnect Button (Disconnect Screen)  
- Adds a **ClipboardReconnect button** below the Quick Join button in the disconnect screen.  
- When pressed, it reconnects you with whatever name you currently have in your clipboard.  

**Example:** You get kicked for not being whitelisted → copy a whitelisted name → press **ClipboardReconnect** → instantly rejoin as that account.  

---

### ⚡ Quick Join Buttons  
- Adds **three Quick Join buttons** (Multiplayer Menu, Game Menu, Disconnect Screen).  
- Uses the server address in your clipboard.  
- Just copy an IP → press Quick Join → instantly connect.  

---

### 🟥 Fake Disconnect Module  
- Lets you **stay inside the world after a disconnect** instead of being kicked to the menu.  
- You can still walk around, explore and look at the world — but no block breaking, player interaction or server communication.  
- If you get kicked, the module shows you a **chat message with the real kick reason**.  

Perfect for exploring or taking a last look at builds **after a disconnect** without instantly being thrown back to the title screen.

### 🆕 Player Name Cycler Module 
- Cycles through **all online player names** on the current server automatically.  
- Automatically logs in with each name and reconnects to the server.  
- Can **stop cycling when an OP account is detected**.  
- Options include:  
  - Set a **hotkey** to start/stop cycling.  
  - **Reconnect delay** between account switches.  
  - Automatically **add missing accounts** to your account manager.  
  - **Debug mode** for detailed logs.  

**Example:** You're on a server and want to cycle through online names to see which accounts have OP:  
- Press the hotkey → module cycles through names → logs in → reconnects → stops when it finds an OP account.

### ⌨️ Quick Join Keybind Module  
- Set a keybind in the module.  
- When pressed, the addon automatically connects you to the server with the IP from your clipboard.  

**Example:** Copy an IP → press the keybind → instantly connect.

### 🔧 Custom Discord RPC Module  
- Adds **custom Discord Rich Presence** support for the Ayquza Addon.  
- Configure your own **application ID, images, and texts** directly in the Meteor settings.   
- Includes in-game buttons to **update, restart, or test the RPC connection**.  

---

### 📸 Disconnect Screenshot Module  
- Automatically saves a screenshot **a few frames before you get disconnected**.  
- Stored in a dedicated subfolder inside your screenshots directory (customizable).  
- Perfect for situations like **server renovations**, where the server closes too quickly for a manual screenshot.  

*Fake Disconnect Module kinda replaces this now since its always 100% guranteed* 

---
